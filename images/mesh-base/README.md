# Mesh Virtual Node Base Image

This project is a part of the [Mesh Manager](https://github.com/USA-RedDragon/mesh-manager) project. Unless
you're developing for the project, you probably want to go there instead.

This project contains DNSMasq, OLSR and a few packages to make a minimal mesh environment. It is
designed to be used as a base image for [mesh-manager](https://github.com/USA-RedDragon/mesh-manager).
