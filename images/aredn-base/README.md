# AREDN Virtual Node Base Image

This project is a part of the [AREDN Cloud Tunnel](https://github.com/USA-RedDragon/aredn-cloud-tunnel) project. Unless
you're developing for the project, you probably want to go there instead.

This project contains DNSMasq, OLSR and a few packages to make a minimal AREDN-compatible environment. It is
designed to be used as a base image for [aredn-manager](https://github.com/USA-RedDragon/aredn-manager) and the
[AREDN Cloud Tunnel](https://github.com/USA-RedDragon/aredn-cloud-tunnel).
